    "The user omitted the particle '로' after '눈물', which is necessary to indicate the means or method by which the feeling of love is experienced.": 1,
    "Without '로', '눈물 사랑' sounds like a compound noun or a phrase meaning 'tear love', which is unnatural in this context.": 1,

    "The user omitted the noun '눈물' (tears) before the particle '로', which is necessary to complete the phrase.": 1,
    "The particle '로' is a postposition that attaches to a noun to indicate means or method, so it cannot stand alone.": 1,
